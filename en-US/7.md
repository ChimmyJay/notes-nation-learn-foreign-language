"Apply conditions that help learning."

# Learning Conditions

Repetition: 8+.

Spaced repetition: days, weeks, months.

Quality repetition:
* Deliberate attention.
* Try recalling and retrieving before looking it up.
* Vary meetings and uses (different forms, contexts, senses).
* Visual aids may help.

Repeatedly work with the same content material across different skills (
reading, writing, speaking, listening).

# Making the Best Use of a Teacher

Not all teachers welcome this, but you can try working with your teacher
to design a balanced, effective, and motivating learning plan for you.

# How Necessary is a Teacher?

A well-informed teacher can be very valuable.

* Maintain balance across the 4 strands of learning activities.
* Identify materials of the right contents and difficulty.
* Be a supportive partner.
  * Practice using the language for communicative purposes.
  * Provide correct models of pronunciation and grammatical use to copy.
  * Provide feedback on errors.
  * Explain words and grammars.
  * Model appropriate language use.
  * Provide useful cultural information.

A well-informed learner can do many of the above on their own.
