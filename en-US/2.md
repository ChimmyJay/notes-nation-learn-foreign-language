"Work out what your needs are and learn what is most useful for you."

# Why Are You Learning the Language?

Understand your needs and motivations and plan accordingly; for example:

* Personal interests
* Living where the language is spoken
* Relationship
* Travel
* Business
* Learning a subject
* Studying for a degree

Your needs and motivations affect the scope and focus of your learning
activities and how hard you work on them.

# Are All Words Created Equal?

Learn high frequency words first because the effort is well repaid by
opportunities to meet and use those words.

Study materials that are right for your current level of proficiency.
